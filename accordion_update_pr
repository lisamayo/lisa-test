## 🔧 Pull Request: Improve Accordion Responsiveness & Animation Stability

### Summary

This PR improves the behavior and performance of the `.evernorth-sdc__accordion` component by addressing several issues:

1. ✅ **Sluggish performance** when opening accordion panels with multilingual or complex content.
2. ✅ **Unintended double-click behavior**, where double-clicking a panel could cause flickering or inconsistent state.
3. ✅ **Abrupt first-open transitions**, which now animate smoothly and consistently.
4. ✅ **Accordion flicker during rapid clicks**, resolved by blocking interaction while a transition is in progress.

### 📦 What Was Changed

#### 1. Improved Animation Performance
- Replaced `clientHeight` with `scrollHeight` for more accurate and less expensive height calculation.
- Removed the use of `height: auto`, which is not animatable and caused layout jank.
- Added a **forced reflow using `offsetHeight`** before setting expanded height to ensure smooth transition on first open.
- Applied `will-change: height` only during the animation to allow the browser to optimize rendering without keeping it active unnecessarily.

#### 2. Prevented Double-Click Issues
- Used `e.detail > 1` to ignore double-click events and prevent rapid, repeated toggles.

#### 3. Prevented Rapid Click Flickering
- Introduced `is-transitioning` class to temporarily disable interaction during a height transition.
- This ensures that clicking multiple accordion headers rapidly won’t cause panels to open and close immediately.

#### 4. Preserved Comment Structure
- All original comments in the accordion JavaScript file were **left unchanged**, per project requirements.

### 🧪 Testing Steps

#### ✅ General Behavior
- [ ] Clicking an accordion item toggles it open/closed.
- [ ] Content expands/contracts smoothly.
- [ ] Only one accordion item opens at a time (if applicable).

#### ✅ Performance & Animation
- [ ] Multilingual and complex content loads quickly (~< 300ms).
- [ ] First-time opening a panel animates smoothly (no abrupt jumps).
- [ ] Transitions are consistent across repeated toggles.

#### ✅ Interaction Robustness
- [ ] Double-clicking an accordion header has no effect.
- [ ] Clicking multiple headers rapidly does **not** cause flickering or accidental close.
- [ ] Accordion interaction is blocked during the transition, then re-enabled cleanly.

#### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] No ESLint errors (e.g., `no-unused-expressions`).
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors or warnings.

### 🚀 Recommendation

Please test across:

- ✅ Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- ✅ Accordions with long text, multilingual content, and edge cases
